# Week 1: Background Estimation

## Folder structure 
The code and data is structured as follows:
   .
   ├── code.ipynb       
   ├── code_color.ipynb                   
   ├── code_gmm.ipynb       
   ├── data_utils.py               
   ├── detect_SOTASubstractors.ipynb     
   ├── detect_YOLOworld.ipynb                 
   ├── evaluation.py       

In this structure:

* `code.ipynb`: Notebook containing code related to the main task.
* `code_color.ipynb`: Notebook specifically focused on color-related tasks.
* `code_gmm.ipynb`: Notebook dedicated to Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM) implementation.
* `data_utils.py`: Python script with utilities for data processing.
* `detect_SOTASubstractors.ipynb`: Notebook for detecting state-of-the-art background subtractors.
* `detect_YOLOworld.ipynb`: Notebook for YOLO world detection.
* `evaluation.py`: Module with functions for evaluating model performance.

## Running the code
Since the code is in _.ipynb_ format, it is required to have _Jupyter Notebook_ or any other program/text editor that can run this kind of file. We recommend using Visual Studio Code with the _Jupyter_ extension.

To replicate the submitted results and ensure that everything works as expected, simply use the __Run all__ button (or run the code blocks from top to bottom).
