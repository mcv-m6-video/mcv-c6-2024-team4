# Week 3: Object Detection and Tracking

## Folder structure 
The code and data is structured as follows:
   .                       
   ├── data
   ├── core
   ├── pyflow
   ├── evaluation.py
   ├── README.md
   ├── task1_1.ipynb
   ├── task1_2.ipynb
   ├── task1_3.ipynb
   ├── utils.py

In this structure:

* `data`: Folder containing S03_C010 video data for the project and its gt annotations.
* `core`: Repository of RAFT.
* `pyflow`: Repository of pyflow.
* `utils.py`: Python script with utilities for data handling and processing.
* `evaluation.py`: Python script containing utilities for object detecion evaluation metrics.
* `tas1_1.ipynb`: Notebook dedicated to implementing Block Matching algorithm.
* `tas1_2.ipynb`: Notebook dedicated to implementing Off-the-shelf Optical Flow algorithms.
* `tas1_3.ipynb`: Notebook dedicated to implementing tracking by adding Optical Flow.

## Running the code
Since the code is in _.ipynb_ format, it is required to have _Jupyter Notebook_ or any other program/text editor that can run this kind of file. We recommend using Visual Studio Code with the _Jupyter_ extension.

To replicate the submitted results and ensure that everything works as expected, simply use the __Run all__ button (or run the code blocks from top to bottom).
