# Welcome to Team 4's Repository for Video Surveillance for Road Project! [MCV-C6]

This repository serves as the collaborative workspace for Team 4 working on the C6 Project. Here, you will find all the code, data, and relevant documentation produced on a weekly basis throughout the project's duration.

## Repository Structure

- **Weekly Submissions**: Each week, we upload the code and data generated during that period in distinct folders named `Week <number>`. In each weekly folder, you will find the source code, datasets and a brief README with instructions to run the code and replicate the results.
